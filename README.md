# ionic-todo
A cross-platform mobile application built with Ionic framework for an ESGI course

## Used IDE
Simply used Visual Studio Code on macOS with the "Cordova Tools" plugin

## Build and test
Running the app on an actual iOS device is too complicated, so let's just emulate:
```
ionic build ios
ionic emulate ios
```
In the other hand, it is much simpler to run on an Android device:
```
ionic build android
ionic run android
```
